        We're not just growers - we're also science geeks. Most of the work that
        goes into perfecting our craft revolves around hours upon hours of
        studying the biology of plant growth and the technology that aids it. We
        believe that before undertaking the journey of growing your own green it
        is a good idea to have a fundamental understanding of what is happening
        as your plant grows in the optimal environment created by our Clevrgreen
        kit.

        been known to be quite therapeutic for those doing it as well. Below are
