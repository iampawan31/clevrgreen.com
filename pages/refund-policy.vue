        Refund Policy
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after
        receiving your item to request a return.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
        that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
        packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
      </div>
      <div class="mt-6">
        To start a return, you can contact us at
        <a class="text-primary" href="mailto:support@clevrgreen.com"
          >support@clevrgreen.com</a
        >. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label,
        as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items
        sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.

          Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
          the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so
          that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.

          Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such
          as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders
          or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty
          products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials,
          flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions
          or concerns about your specific item.

          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
          you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase
          for the new item.

          We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
          let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
          automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please
          remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to
          process and post the refund too.
