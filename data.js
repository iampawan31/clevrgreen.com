    content:
      '<p><strong>Aeroponic systems</strong> are systems where a plant is not grown in a medium. Unlike growing in soil, or in water (hydroponics), the plant is suspended in the air and water is sprayed on the roots through a water-pump and sprinkler system.</p><br /><p>By using this type of system in our kit the quality of plant life can be better controlled by avoiding several issues that can happen when growing in a medium such as soil or water. This means more quantity and quality green can be grown.</p>',

An intake fan moves fresh air into and around the set-up while an exhaust fan moves air out of the system through a filter that minimizes odor.</p>',

    title: 'What is required to setup my kit?',
    content:
      'Our kits requires very little in order to setup and properly function. No additional tools are required and all necessary equipment is included for managing the entire grow cycle. However, it is important to have the following requirements met to have a successful grow: <br><br><b> A 3x3x6 area within your dwelling.&nbsp;</b>We recommend setting up in an area of your dwelling that has good insulation and adequate space (1 ft in front of the unit) so that you have room to access the unit. We do not recommend placing the unit a poorly insulated space such as an attic or garage however if this is your only option there are additional components that can be purchased to accommodate this. Please let our Mastergrowers know during our initial consultation if you are planning to do so.<br><br> <b>Wireless Internet </b> is required in order for the automation functions to work. Without WIFI the kit can still be operated however lighting and water and ventilation units will need to be manually turned on and off at the correct scheduling.<br><br><b>Stable Ambient Temperature </b> is required for the plants to have the proper environment to grow. We recommend making sure the dwelling is kept between 70-80 degree Fahrenheit. Although the Mylar Tent works to insulate and maintain proper humidity and temperature levels, excess or low temperatures can cause catastrophic failure in the growing process and result in deceased plants.',
